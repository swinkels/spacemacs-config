This repo contains my personal configuration of the [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] distribution of
Emacs. I maintain this config for Spacemacs commit [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/commit/2dadee57110fc9db43756fcad08af9ac3ae7c9fa][2dadee5]], 1 February 2024, and
use it with Emacs version 28.2.

* Installation

To install my configuration, you have to install Spacemacs first. To do so,
clone Spacemacs to ~$HOME/.emacs.d~ and checkout the correct commit[fn:1]:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs.git ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d && git checkout 2dadee5
#+end_src
Spacemacs is an extensive, unifying layer on top of (literally) hundreds of
other packages, most of which are being developed independently of Spacemacs.
What you've cloned just now is "only" the code for the Spacemacs layer, not the
dependent packages.

Next, clone the current repo to ~$HOME/.spacemacs.d~:
#+begin_src bash
git clone develop https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs.git ~/.spacemacs.d
#+end_src
The rest of this README uses ~.spacemacs.d~ for ~$HOME/.spacemacs.d~.

Now, when you start Emacs, it will automatically download and install all
dependent packages.

The above command also clones [[https://github.com/swinkels/yasnippets][my YASnippet files]] as a Git submodule to
subdirectory ~snippets~[fn:2]. Spacemacs will automatically pick them up from
this directory. The use of Git submodules is a story in itself and I'm still on
the fence if an ordinary subdirectory with its own Git repo would not be easier.
When in doubt, treat ~snippets~ as any subdirectory with its own Git repo, for
example, a ~git pull~ in that directory will retrieve my latest snippets.

* User configuration

Spacemacs picks up the following files from ~.spacemacs.d~:

- ~init.el~ :: This file is the so-called Spacemacs dotfile. It configures
  several high-level aspects of Spacemacs, such as layers to use, default
  editing style and use of a startup banner. It also stores the persistent
  settings from the Customize interface.
- ~<current-machine-name>-user-config.el~ :: This optional file contains
  configurations that are only relevant for the current machine. For example,
  variables that contain local paths.
- ~user-config.el~ :: This file contains configuration that cannot be done via
  the Customize interface, or cannot be done easily via that interface. For
  example, custom key bindings and workarounds for issues in third-party
  packages.

~.spacemacs.d~ also contains the shell script ~emacs-nw~, which starts a
terminal Emacs session to a running Emacs instance. If not Emacs instance is
running, it will start one. To install the script, copy it to a directory in
your path, for example ~/.local/bin~.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] This command checks out branch ~main~ of this repo, which will be the
  right branch /most of the times/. This repo also has a branch ~develop~, which
  I use to update my config for newer versions of Spacemacs or Emacs.

[fn:2] [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][YASnippet]] is a package to insert user-configurable templates.
