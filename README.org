This repo contains my personal configuration of the [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] distribution of
Emacs.

This config is maintained for Spacemacs commit [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/commit/2dadee57110fc9db43756fcad08af9ac3ae7c9fa][2dadee7]], 1 February 2024, and in
use with Emacs version 28.2.

* Installation

This configuration comes with shell script ~emacs-nw~ to start a terminal Emacs
session to a running Emacs instance. To install it, copy it to a directory in
your path, for example ~/.local/bin~.

* User configuration

You can find the user configuration in ~user-config.el~
