- [X] remove warning about orphan packages

On Spacemacs startup, Spacemacs mentioned it would delete 2 orphan packages,
~guile~ and ~mu4e~. These are system packages that come with Guix packages and
the deletion would (silently) fail. Spacemacs would try again the next time it
started. I've added both packages to ~dotspacemacs-additional-packages~ so
Spacemacs leaves them alone.


- [X] update config for latest Emacs version on Guix

I updated spacemacs to commit abba23b6 from 25 December 2024 and used Emacs 29.4
for that.

- [X] remove ~magit~ shell script

I have never used this script "in production". I only used it to test it and
even then it was prone to corrupting the display of characters in the terminal.
